        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a Bakery Student that works at Glasgow residence dining hall. I am also a Sociology student at the University of California - Riverside. My job as a bakery student is to help the head bakers that I work with, along with the other student bakers. I help them bake, set out desserts for other students to eat, do service records, take care of the ice cream machine, and more. I am able to work well with others and work extremely well under pressure. I am organized and efficient when it comes to my work. I am able to make several different desserts and I am able to try to make any new desserts that are asked of me. This allows me to explore my options with food and better prepare me for living on my own. This also helps me to develop skills that I will be able to use in future jobs. I am able to learn new things quickly and I am able to help delegate work between coworkers. <br><br>

        Currently I am living in college dorms where I am able to meet new people who show me new skills everyday. I am friendly and a good judge of character. I am able to befriend new people with extreme ease, as well as setting up little social get togethers that serve as a pick me up. This allows everyone to stay on top of their game and continuously do well in school and work. I have hopes of becoming a social worker in the future, as it is something that I have been wanting to do for years. This is a job that can be very taxing, yet rewarding for people. The different skills that I have acquired ensure that I will be able to take care of myself, while also being able to take care of other people.<br><br>

        Currently I am enrolled in the University of California - Riverside in the Sociology bachelor's program. There were very few colleges within California that offered Social Work as a degree option for bachelors, so I decided to pursue Sociology for my B.A. I will then hopefully pursue a higher level of education and get my masters in social work. This will help me help other people that are in need of help. After I get my credentials and degree I am hoping that I will be able to work in a hospital as a social worker. This would allow me to help so many people as well as allow me to be constantly learning new things. I believe that no matter how much you know there are always new things to learn. Which is why it is good that I am able to pick things up so quickly. I also am very empathetic and emotionally intelligent. This allows me to get a deeper connection with people that I may not have been able to get with just my words. This is because actions to people speak just as loudly as words, if not more. It is my hope that you will help make this dream a reality.
